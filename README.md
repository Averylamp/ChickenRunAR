# Chicken Run AR
This is the repository for our game, Chicken Run AR.

# Build

To build and deploy to devices, we use [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/). Contact `averylamp@gmail.com` to have a build shared with you. Note that this requires iOS (preferably an iPhone) that supports ARKit 3.0. To build locally, open the project in Unity, change the build environment to iOS, and complete as expected.
